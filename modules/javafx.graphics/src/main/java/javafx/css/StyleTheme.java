/**
 * {@code StyleTheme} is a collection of user-agent stylesheets that specify the appearance of UI controls and
 * other nodes in the application. {@code StyleTheme} is implicitly used by all JavaFX nodes in the scene graph,
 * unless it is overridden by any of the following properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link Application#userAgentStylesheetProperty() Application.userAgentStylesheet}
 *     <li>{@link Scene#userAgentStylesheetProperty() Scene.userAgentStylesheet}
 *     <li>{@link SubScene#userAgentStylesheetProperty() SubScene.userAgentStylesheet}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The list of stylesheets that comprise a {@code StyleTheme} can be modified while the application is running,
 * enabling applications to create dynamic themes that respond to changing user preferences.
 * <p>
 * A {@code StyleTheme} can be applied using the {@link Application#setUserAgentStyleTheme(StyleTheme)} method:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     public class App extends Application {
 *         @Override
 *         public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
 *             setUserAgentStyleTheme(new MyCustomTheme());

     * Gets the list of stylesheet URLs that comprise this {@code StyleTheme}.
     * <p>
     * The URL is a hierarchical URI of the form [scheme:][//authority][path]. If the URL
     * does not have a [scheme:] component, the URL is considered to be the [path] component only.
     * Any leading '/' character of the [path] is ignored and the [path] is treated as a path relative to
     * the root of the application's classpath.
     * <p>
     * The RFC 2397 "data" scheme for URLs is supported in addition to the protocol handlers that
     * are registered for the application.
     * If a URL uses the "data" scheme and the MIME type is either empty, "text/plain", or "text/css",
     * the payload will be interpreted as a CSS file.
     * If the MIME type is "application/octet-stream", the payload will be interpreted as a binary
     * CSS file (see {@link Stylesheet#convertToBinary(File, File)}).
     * <p>
     * If the list of stylesheets that comprise this {@code StyleTheme} is changed at runtime, this
     * method must return an {@link ObservableList} to allow the CSS subsystem to subscribe to list
     * change notifications.
     *
     * @implSpec Implementations of this method that return an {@link ObservableList} must emit all
     *           change notifications on the JavaFX application thread.
     *
     * @implNote Implementations of this method that return an {@link ObservableList} are encouraged
     *           to minimize the number of subsequent list change notifications that are fired by the
     *           list, as each change notification causes the CSS subsystem to re-apply the referenced
     *           stylesheets.
